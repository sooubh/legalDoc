- **Analyzes legal documents clause-by-clause**: Breaks down complex legal documents into individual clauses with plain-language explanations, risk assessments, and detailed analysis
- **Provides role-specific perspectives**: Shows tailored interpretations for different parties (Tenant vs Landlord, Employee vs Employer, Consumer vs Business) with obligations and risks specific to each role
- **Generates comprehensive insights**: Creates plain summaries, risk radar with severity levels, actionable follow-up points, and verified legal citations
- **Supports multiple input methods**: Accepts text pasting or PDF uploads (with text extraction and OCR fallback)
- **Offers bilingual support**: Provides analysis in English and Hindi with multiple simplification levels (professional, simple, ELI5)
- **Creates visualizations**: Auto-generates flowcharts, timelines, and responsibility matrices using Mermaid diagrams
- **Includes sample contracts**: Pre-loaded sample documents (Service Agreement, Mutual NDA, Residential Lease) in both English and Hindi for quick testing
- **Provides interactive chat**: Optional Q&A feature to ask questions about the analyzed document
- **Modern UI experience**: Light/dark theme support, fullscreen modals, sticky PDF viewer, and responsive design

The product uses Google's Gemini AI API to power the analysis and is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
